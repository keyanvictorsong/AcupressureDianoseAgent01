TCM Meridian Pathways and Referred Pain Patterns

Overview of the Twelve Primary Meridians

In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the body’s vital energy (Qi) flows through twelve primary meridians, each corresponding to specific organ systems. Below we detail each meridian’s pathway (with start and end points) and show how imbalances can manifest along these paths. For completeness, the Ren (Conception) and Du (Governing) Vessels – often considered additional channels – are also included. Short glowing lines on the figures indicate meridian courses, with dots for key acupoints. (Note: Front-view silhouettes are shown for meridians primarily on the anterior aspect; posterior meridians are typically illustrated on a back view.)

Lung Meridian (手太阴肺经, LU)

Lung Meridian – Pathway running from the chest (LU-1 area) through the inner arm to the thumb.
Pathway: Originates internally in the middle jiao (stomach region) and connects to the Large Intestine, then ascends to the lungs and throat. It emerges on the chest near LU-1 (first intercostal space under the clavicle) ￼ ￼. From there it travels outward and down the antero-lateral side of the shoulder and arm, along the forearm’s radial (thumb) side. The channel passes the wrist (radial artery area) and the thenar eminence (base of thumb), ending at the radial tip of the thumb (acupuncture point LU-11) ￼ ￼. A small branch separates at LU-7 (wrist) to connect with the Large Intestine meridian on the index finger ￼. (Key acupoints along LU meridian include Zhongfu (LU-1), Chize (LU-5 at elbow crease), Lieque (LU-7 near wrist), and Shaoshang (LU-11 at thumb tip).)

Large Intestine Meridian (手阳明大肠经, LI)

Pathway: Begins at the radial side of the index finger (LI-1) and runs up the lateral aspect of the arm ￼. It ascends past the elbow and shoulder to the highest point of the shoulder (LI-15), then crosses over the shoulder to the supraclavicular area ￼. From there, an internal branch connects to the lung and descends to the Large Intestine organ. Externally, the meridian ascends along the neck and cheek, circling around the lower lip. It ends at the side of the nose (LI-20), where it meets the Stomach meridian ￼. (Notable points: Hegu (LI-4) on the hand, a key point for pain and immunity, and Yingxiang (LI-20) beside the nostril.)

Stomach Meridian (足阳明胃经, ST)

Pathway: Starts beside the nose at the ala nasi (near LI-20). It ascends to the bridge of the nose and inner corner of the eye, then descends lateral to the nose and around the mouth to the chin ￼ ￼. From the jaw, it runs down the front of the neck and chest. The meridian then continues down through the abdomen about 2 cun lateral to the midline, and passes through the inguinal region ￼. It travels along the front of the thigh and down the antero-lateral aspect of the lower leg, over the dorsum of the foot. The Stomach channel terminates at the lateral side of the second toe (ST-45) ￼ ￼. (Notable points: Zu San Li (ST-36, below the knee) for digestive and energy issues ￼, and Neiting (ST-44) between the toes for clearing heat.)

Spleen Meridian (足太阴脾经, SP)

Pathway: Begins at the medial side of the big toe (SP-1) and runs along the medial edge of the foot ￼. It ascends in front of the medial malleolus (ankle) and up the inner aspect of the lower leg ￼. Continuing along the inner thigh, it enters the groin and lower abdomen. The spleen channel then runs upward 4 cun lateral to the midline of the abdomen, moving toward the chest. It spreads to the lower chest area, reaching the 2nd intercostal space on the mid-axillary line (around SP-21) ￼ ￼. Internally it connects with the Spleen and Stomach, and a branch links up to the Heart. (Key points: Yinlingquan (SP-9 at the knee) for dampness, Sanyinjiao (SP-6 above the ankle) where three yin leg meridians meet.)

Heart Meridian (手少阴心经, HT)

Pathway: Originates in the Heart organ itself and descends internally to connect with the Small Intestine. Externally, it emerges from the axilla (underarm) at HT-1 ￼. It then travels down the posterior-medial side of the arm, along the inner side of the biceps and the ulnar side of the forearm. The Heart meridian passes the wrist (HT-7 at the crease) and runs to the palm’s ulnar side, ending at the radial corner of the little finger nail (HT-9) ￼. A connecting branch from the Heart links to the Small Intestine meridian at the little finger. (Notable points: Shenmen (HT-7) at the wrist for calming the spirit, and Shaochong (HT-9) at the pinky tip for revival and heart heat.)

Small Intestine Meridian (手太阳小肠经, SI)

Pathway: Begins at the ulnar side of the little finger (SI-1) and runs up the back (posterior) side of the hand and arm ￼. It travels along the lateral-posterior aspect of the shoulder to the scapula region (SI-11 area) ￼. From the shoulder blade, it zigzags upward to the upper back (near SI-14/15) and then to the supraclavicular fossa. Internally it connects to the Heart and Stomach organs. A branch ascends the neck and cheek to the outer canthus of the eye, then enters the ear (SI-19) ￼, linking with the Gall Bladder channel (around GB-1). The meridian terminates around the front of the ear at SI-19. (Key points: Tinggong (SI-19) for ear issues, Houxi (SI-3) on the hand for neck/back tension.)

Bladder Meridian (足太阳膀胱经, BL)

Pathway: The Bladder meridian is the longest channel, running along the entire back of the body. It begins at the inner corner of the eye (BL-1) and goes up over the forehead and crown of the head ￼. From the vertex it enters the brain briefly, then emerges to bifurcate into two parallel branches down the back of the head and neck. Along the back, one branch runs just beside the spine while the second branch runs roughly 1.5 cun lateral to the first, creating two columns of Bladder channel points down the paraspinal area ￼. The branches continue down through the lumbar region and buttocks. They reunite in the gluteal region and proceed down the posterior aspect of the thigh and calf. The meridian passes behind the lateral malleolus (ankle) and ends at the lateral side of the small toe (BL-67) ￼, where it connects to the Kidney channel. (Notable points: Jingming (BL-1) at the inner canthus for eye issues, and Kunlun (BL-60) behind the ankle for pain along the channel.)

Kidney Meridian (足少阴肾经, KI)

Pathway: Begins beneath the foot at the sole, under the little toe (KI-1, Yongquan) ￼. It crosses the arch of the foot and emerges behind the inner ankle (KI-3 area). The Kidney meridian ascends the medial aspect of the leg, passing through the calf and inner knee, then continues up the inner thigh ￼. It enters the spine near the kidney area, connecting internally with the Kidneys and its paired organ, the Bladder ￼. The channel then ascends through the abdomen parallel to the midline, 0.5 cun lateral to the Ren channel. It passes through the chest, terminating just below the clavicle (KI-27). An internal branch rises to the throat and root of the tongue, which is why Kidney channel imbalances can affect tongue and throat ￼. (Key points: Taixi (KI-3) at the ankle for Kidney tonification, Yongquan (KI-1) on the sole for grounding and resuscitation.)

Pericardium Meridian (手厥阴心包经, PC)

Pathway: Originates in the chest (the pericardial region) and descends through the diaphragm, connecting internally with the upper/middle/lower jiao (the three body cavities) ￼. Externally, it emerges on the lateral chest near PC-1 (in the 4th intercostal space). From there it runs along the inner arm between the Lung and Heart channel pathways ￼. It travels down the center of the anterior forearm. At the wrist (PC-7 area), it passes through the carpal tunnel region and into the palm. The meridian ends at the tip of the middle finger (PC-9) ￼. (A branch from the palm also connects to the San Jiao meridian at the ring finger.) (Notable points: Neiguan (PC-6) on the forearm for nausea and anxiety, and Laogong (PC-8, center of palm) for clearing heat.)

San Jiao (Triple Burner) Meridian (手少阳三焦经, SJ)

Pathway: Begins at the ulnar side of the ring finger (SJ-1) and runs up the back of the hand and posterior arm ￼. It travels upward behind the arm, passing the elbow (around SJ-10) and along the shoulder. The channel then goes to the supraclavicular fossa (near ST-12 region) ￼. From there, one branch descends internally through the upper, middle, and lower jiao (thorax, abdomen, pelvis) connecting to the pericardium and the three divisions of the torso. Another external branch ascends the neck, goes around the ear, and circles over to the temple. It ultimately terminates at the lateral end of the eyebrow (SJ-23) ￼. (Key points: Waiguan (SJ-5) on forearm for releasing the exterior (fevers, headaches), and Ermen (SJ-21) near the ear for ear issues.)

Gallbladder Meridian (足少阳胆经, GB)

Pathway: Starts at the outer canthus of the eye (GB-1) and ascends to the corner of the forehead. It then winds down behind the ear (passing GB-12) and zigzags across the side of the head (through points like GB-14 on the forehead) ￼. The meridian travels down the side of the neck to the top of the shoulder (GB-21) and then along the lateral aspect of the ribcage. It continues downward along the side of the torso and the lateral hip (encircling the gluteal region) ￼. Then it goes down the lateral side of the thigh and leg. Passing the knee and fibula, it reaches the anterior lateral malleolus. The channel ends at the lateral side of the 4th toe (GB-44) ￼. (Notable points: Fengchi (GB-20) at the skull base for headaches, and Zulinqi (GB-41) on the foot for lateral foot pain and hormonal regulation.)

Liver Meridian (足厥阴肝经, LV)

Pathway: Begins at the lateral side of the big toe (LV-1) and runs along the top of the foot to the ankle ￼. It ascends in front of the medial malleolus and up the medial aspect of the lower leg and knee. Continuing along the inner thigh, it enters the pubic region. The Liver meridian encircles the external genitalia and then ascends the lower abdomen, where it internally connects with the Liver and Gallbladder organs ￼. It continues upward along the abdomen and chest, reaching the area below the nipple (LV-14) in the 6th intercostal space. An internal branch moves up through the diaphragm, along the throat to the nasopharynx and connects to the eyes and the vertex of the head ￼. (This explains why Liver channel imbalances can affect vision.) The external primary channel, however, ends in the costal region below the breasts (at LV-14). (Key points: Taichong (LV-3) on the foot for soothing Liver Qi and stress, and Qimen (LV-14) for Liver and chest disorders.)

Conception Vessel (任脉, Ren Mai)

Pathway: The Ren Mai is the midline channel running along the front of the body, governing the yin meridians. It originates in the lower abdomen/uterus and emerges at the perineum (Ren-1) ￼. Externally, it ascends straight up the anterior midline – passing through the pubic area (Ren-2), the belly (Ren-6, Ren-8 at the navel), the chest (Ren-17 at the sternum) – all the way to the throat and chin. It terminates at Ren-24, in the depression between the lower lip and chin ￼. (Ren Mai is often called the “Sea of Yin” as it connects all the Yin channels; it influences the reproductive system, abdomen, and thorax.)

Governing Vessel (督脉, Du Mai)

Pathway: The Du Mai is the midline channel running along the back, governing the yang meridians. It begins in the lower abdomen (and in men, internally in the genital region) and emerges at the perineum (Du-1, near the tailbone) ￼. Externally, it ascends the midline of the spine, passing through the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae (with points along the spine like Du-4 at L2 level, Du-14 at C7) up to the neck. It continues over the head, along the midline of the skull (Du-20 at the crown), and down the forehead. The channel ends at the upper gum inside the mouth, with its last point being Du-28 just inside the upper lip ￼. (Du Mai is the “Sea of Yang,” connecting all Yang channels; it influences the spine, brain, and nervous system.)

Sources: The meridian pathways above are based on standard TCM anatomy ￼ ￼ with corroboration from acupuncture texts and clinical descriptions ￼ ￼. Each meridian’s trajectory has been verified against authoritative sources to ensure correct start and end points and route (e.g. the Lung meridian from chest to thumb ￼, and the Bladder meridian down the entire back to the small toe ￼).

Spinal Misalignment, Nerve Compression, and Referred Pain

The user also inquired about spinal rotation or muscle imbalances and whether these can “press on nerves, tendons, or meridians,” and how pain in one area might originate from problems elsewhere. This relates to the concept of referred pain and the interplay between structural imbalances and energy pathways:
	•	Nerve Compression: When the spine is misaligned (e.g. rotated vertebrae or poor posture), it can compress or irritate spinal nerves. A mispositioned vertebra may pinch a nerve root exiting the spine, leading to pain or tingling along that nerve’s distribution ￼. For example, a lumbar spine misalignment can press on the sciatic nerve, causing leg pain (sciatica) even though the leg itself has no injury ￼. This shows how pain in a distal location can stem from a nerve issue at the spine.
	•	Muscle Strain and Tendons: Muscle imbalances (unequal strength or tightness) around the spine or joints can cause certain muscles to overcompensate. This leads to chronic strain and tension in those muscles ￼. Tight or rotated back muscles may not directly “pinch” tendons, but they can pull joints out of optimal alignment, causing tendons and ligaments to rub or strain abnormally. Over time, this contributes to tendon inflammation or joint pain. For instance, if hip muscles are imbalanced, the knee’s alignment can be altered, putting stress on tendons around the knee. Thus, a patient’s knee pain might actually be due to a hip or pelvic imbalance (the knee tendons are stressed secondary to the misalignment, rather than a primary tendon injury).
	•	Foot/Ankle Alignment and Knee Pain: A common example of referred pain from imbalance is knee pain caused by foot or ankle misalignment. If the arches of the feet collapse (flat feet) or the foot overpronates inward, it causes the lower leg to twist and the knee to track improperly. The result is undue pressure on the knee joint and surrounding tissues ￼ ￼. In practice, a patient may report knee pain, but the root cause could be their foot mechanics (e.g. collapsed arch or ankle instability). Correcting the foot alignment (through orthotics, exercises, etc.) often relieves the knee pain, underscoring that the painful site wasn’t the actual origin of the problem ￼ ￼.
	•	TCM Meridians and Qi Stagnation: In TCM theory, structural misalignments can also disrupt the flow of Qi and blood in the meridians. A rotated spine or tense muscles may correspond to meridian blockages. For example, chronic back misalignment could block the Bladder meridian along the spine, leading to pain or tightness in that channel. TCM bone-setting texts note that misaligned bones/joints are seen as obstructing Qi and blood circulation, resulting in pain and stiffness ￼. Realigning the body is thought to restore proper meridian flow. In other words, while Western medicine speaks of nerve compression, TCM would add that the free flow of energy in the affected meridian (say, the Kidney/Bladder meridian in the lower back) is impeded, causing pain until the blockage is relieved.
	•	Referred Pain Patterns: It’s important to recognize that pain is not always felt at its source. This is true both in Western anatomy (nerve referral, muscular compensation) and in TCM (meridian pathways). A classic Western example is sciatic pain (shooting down the leg), which originates from the lumbar spine nerve root compression ￼. Another is heart attack pain referring to the left arm – the issue is the heart, but pain manifests down the arm via shared nerve pathways. In TCM, an Liver meridian imbalance might cause vertex headaches or eye pain along that meridian, even though the liver organ is in the abdomen ￼. The diagnostic app idea – where a patient points to where it hurts and the app suggests possible problem sources – would need to account for these patterns. It should incorporate knowledge that “where it hurts may not be where the problem is.” This requires mapping common referral patterns: e.g., knee pain could indicate ankle or hip dysfunction (biomechanically) or perhaps Gallbladder meridian issues (if along the lateral knee), etc.

Key Takeaway: A spinal rotation or muscle imbalance is most likely to compress nerves ￼, and strained muscles can indirectly stress tendons and joints. In TCM terms, these misalignments lead to meridian energy blockage ￼. Therefore, comprehensive diagnosis is needed: one must evaluate the entire kinetic chain and meridian system to find the true origin of pain. By addressing the root cause – releasing a pinched nerve, correcting posture/foot alignment, or balancing meridian flow – the distal pain can be relieved.
